					<h1>METACHAIN<br>
						Privacy policy
					</h1>
					<p>Reviewed in February 2023</p>
					<p>We at Metachain respect your personal data. That is why, we have tried to make information in
						this Privacy Policy
						understandable and clear, while boring only to the extent, required by the law.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="info__blocks info__blocks__1">
					<h2>Why do we process your data?</h2>
					<div>
						<p>Generally, we use your data for marketing purposes. Keep in mind that you can always withdraw
							your consent by leaving us
							a clear note at corporate@meta-chain.tech at any time.</p>
						<p>
							Also, you may always object to our processing activities based on the legitimate interest
							and have your data completely
							erased from all our systems. Just write us about your intent at corporate@meta-chain.tech
						</p>
						<p>In both cases, we’ll stop the processing of your data as soon as we find your note in our
							Inbox, which shall not take
							more than a business day. Please also not that if you withdraw your consent for direct
							marketing by clicking Unsubscribe
							button, we will not delete the rest of your data automatically. But you may request us to do
							so by sending us an email
							to the address above.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="info__blocks info__blocks__2">
